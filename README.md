# Neighborhood Map

As project 5 for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, I built a responsive website that will display a map where some markers will identify
locations a user is interested in.

## Getting Started

To view the website, download a copy of the project to your local machine and open the file index.html with your browser.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - The web framework used
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/web/) - The map API used

## Author

* **Daniele Erb√¨** - [daniel-234](https://github.com/daniel-234)

## Notes

The app will display 5 locations in my city when the page loads.
