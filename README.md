# Neighborhood Map

Project 5 for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree consisted in the development of a single page application featuring a map of a chosen neighborhood.
Some functionality was added to this map, including highlighted locations and third-party data about these locations.
This app was developed making use of Knockout JS, a JavaScript framework implementing the MVVM design pattern, to assist in organizing code in a manageable way.
The map is loaded using the Google Maps API library and the MediaWikiAPI for Wikipedia is used to add specific content, when available, to the highlighted locations.

## Getting Started

To load the app, download a copy of the project to your local machine and open the file index.html with your browser.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - Framework for developing responsive, mobile first websites
* [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) - A JavaScript library that simplifies dynamic JavaScript UIs
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - A JavaScript library for simpler HTML manipulation and event handling
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/web/) - The map API used
* [MediaWikiAPI for Wikipedia](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) - the third party API used to provide information when a location is selected

## Author

## Notes

The app will display several locations in the city center of Cagliari (Italy) when the page is loaded.

* I relied on some answers on Stackoverflow and an article to make the map set center and bounds dynamically based on markers and viewport change:
* [Stackoverflow - Center/Set Zoom of Map to cover all visible Markers?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19304574/center-set-zoom-of-map-to-cover-all-visible-markers)

* To refactor the code to make use of the JavaScript library KnockoutJS, I used the following resources:
* [KnockoutJS documentation](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html)

* To handle the two Views on the same page and the different ViewModels, I relied on this answer on Stackoverflow:
* [Stackoverflow - Example of knockout js pattern for multi-view applications](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8676988/example-of-knockoutjs-pattern-for-multi-view-applications/8680668#8680668)
* To understand the Custom Bindings feature of KnockoutJS I read several articles and some book paragraphs. The most important for adapting it to my needs were:

* I read different posts on how to populate the list View using Knockout 'template' binding instead of DOM manipulation. The most complete suggestion on how to solve the problem of updating the observable array after the array it wraps is updated is the following one:
